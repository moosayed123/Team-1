# Automated Attendance System

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a **complete school management system** that covers three main components:

### 1. Attendance and Access Control at the School Gate
Using AI and embedded systems, the system identifies attendance at the school gate. Recognized individuals are automatically logged, and the gate opens for them. If an **unrecognized person** is detected, a notification is sent to supervisors like **Mr. Mohamed Adly** or **Mr. Ahmed Fouad** to decide whether to allow entry.

### 2. Student Assistance System
This module helps students with school-related questions without needing to approach school supervisors, thus reducing interruptions in their workflow.

### 3. Substitute Class Management System
Mr. **Ahmed Fouad**, the scheduling expert, uses this system to manage substitute classes. Teachers are notified of substitute classes and reminded of their sessions to prevent delays. Additionally, the system automatically rings the school bell for each class and break.
